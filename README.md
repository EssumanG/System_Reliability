# Find The Reliability Of A Canonical System

A Canonical System is system whose system is arranged either in *series* or *parallel* or both.

This program is design to automatically calculate for the reliability of a given system.


### For Simplicity, assuming a system contains to module say ```A``` and ```B```;

If the Modules are in ```Series```, the Reliability of the sytem will be expressed as

    R(sys) = A * B 
    where * denotes as the serires connection


If the Modules are in Parallel, the Reliability of the sytem will be expressed as

    R(sys) = A | B 
    where | denotes as the parallel connection
